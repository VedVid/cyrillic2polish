#### What?

Simple parser to transliterate and transcript cyrillic script, using simplified PN-ISO standard.

#### Why?

In Polish media I see English-based transcription of cyrillic script often. Usually, it is not obvious how these names should be read. For example, according to polish norms, Михаил Барышников should transcript to Michaił Barysznikow, not Mikhail Baryshnikov.

#### Limitations

First of all, it is the toy project, not intended for real-world use.

Current implementation does not support gemination lookups.

It transcripts from Russian - other languages that use cyrillic script may be subjected to different set of transcription rules.
